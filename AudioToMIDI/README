To run:
java -jar audioToText.jar

You have to modify the "Open" field to enable the button.
And type *.wav in the field. The *.wav file must exist in this folder.

Same naming convention requirements, goes for the capture field.
Be careful of writing over existing files via capture.

They are not really .wav files. Close, but without the metadata.
